/**
 * Captures meta data about outputs from the pipeline. This includes
 * accurate timestamps of how long different aspects of processing took
 * (for example, how long it was queued for running, etc), as well as
 * accurate timestamps for the file modified time (since some file systems
 * only give coarse values for this, eg 1 second resolution. Also included
 * are user-modifiable attributes such as whether the file is indicated
 * as to be preserved from cleanup, or whether it was actually cleaned up
 * as opposed to hard removed.
 * <p>
 * Currently these objects are serialized as property files in the .bpipe/outputs
 * directory. This design, however, is not very scalable as people are using 
 * Bpipe in pipelines that create tens of thousands of output files which can 
 * lead to it taking a long time to scan and read this directory. 
 * A more database-like format such as SQLite may be more suitable. As an 
 * intermediate step, the whole graph of these files is currently serialized
 * using Java serialization so that for simple operations the graph can be
 * read back into memory without having to scan each property file 
 * (see Dependencies#saveOutputGraph()).
